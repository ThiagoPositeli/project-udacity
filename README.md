<h1>Data Modeling Project 1 with Postgree</h1>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.


<h3>Project Description</h3>
In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.


<h3>Getting started</h3>

<code>python create_tables.py</code>
<code>python etl.py</code>


<h3>Python scripts</h3>
    
create_tables.py: Create the tables and preview the schema
sql_queries.py: All the querys in ETL.
etl.py: Read the json files and do the ETL pipelines.

 - songplays: Records in log data associated with song plays
 - users: Users in the app
 - songs: Songs in music database
 - artists: Artists in music database
 - time: Timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units


<h3>ETL Pipeline</h3>

    
<h4>Song Dataset</h4>
    
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
    
<code>song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json</code>
   

<h5>Final Tables</h5> 

 - songs table: Save song ID, title, artist ID, year, and duration from dataset

 - artist table: Save artist ID, name, location, latitude, and longitude from dataset

<h4>Log Dataset</h4>

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
    
    
 <code>log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json</code>
     
<h5>Final Tables</h5>
 - time table: Select ts from dataset and save extracted the timestamp, hour, day, week of year, month, year, and weekday from the ts field.

 - users table: Save user ID, first name, last name, gender and level. If duplicated user information is delivered, Update level field.

 - songplays table: Save the timestamp, user ID, level, song ID, artist ID, session ID, location, and user agent from dataset. The song ID and artist ID will be retrieved by querying the songs and artists tables to find matches based on song title, artist name, and song duration time.
